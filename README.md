Project Title:
Pizza Sales Analysis with SQL By Akshat Srivastava

Objective:
Leverage SQL to explore and answer key business questions about a pizza chain’s sales data, helping stakeholders understand ordering patterns, customer behavior, and product performance.

Dataset & Tools:

Data Source: CSV tables (Orders, Customers, Menu, Order_Items, etc.)

Environment: MySQL / SQL Workbench

Core Components & Queries:

- Sales Summaries

    Total and average order value per month

    Year‑over‑year growth of revenue

- Customer Insights

    Top 10 customers by spend

    Customer retention: count of repeat vs. one‑time buyers

- Menu Performance

    Best‑ and worst‑selling pizza types

    Revenue contribution by category (e.g., beverages, sides, desserts)

- Order Patterns

    Peak ordering hours and days of week

    Analysis of order size (number of items per order)

- Promotions & Discounts

    Impact of discount codes on average order value

    Uptake rate of promotional offers

Key Takeaways:

  - High‑Value Segments: A small group of power‑users drives a large share of revenue.
  
  - Menu Optimization: Certain pizza varieties underperform and may be candidates for removal or re‑promotion.
  
  - Operational Scheduling: Peak demand times identified for staffing and kitchen readiness.
  
  - Marketing Effectiveness: Discounts increase order frequency but can erode margin if over‑used.

Business Impact:
  
  - Data‑driven recommendations to streamline menu offerings
  
  - Targeted marketing strategies for top customers
  
  - Better staffing forecasts during peak periods
  
  - Optimized promotional campaigns to maximize profit
